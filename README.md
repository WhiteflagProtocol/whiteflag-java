# Whiteflag Java Library

Whiteflag is a fully neutral and secure communciations means based on
blockchain technology. It enables near real-time communication in armed
conflicts and disasters to exchange early warning and status information
to create shared situational awareness.

The Whiteflag Java Library (WFJL) is to be an implementation of the Whiteflag
Protocol in Java to support the development of Whiteflag-enabled applications.
The WFJL is to support the all Whiteflag protocol features, but with minimal
dependencies. Therefore, the library is independent from any specific
blockchain, database solution, user interface, etc.

The planned WFJL functionality can be found in `SCOPE.md`.

The WFJL is currently in early stages of development. More details will follow
as progress is made.
