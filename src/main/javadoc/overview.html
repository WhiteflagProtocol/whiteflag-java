    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://java.whiteflagprotocol.org/" target="_blank">Whiteflag Java Library</a> (WFJL)
        is an implementation of the <a href="https://www.whiteflagprotocol.org/" target="_blank">Whiteflag Protocol</a>
        in Java to support the development of Whiteflag-enabled applications. The WFJL is to
        include all Whiteflag protocol features, but with minimal dependencies. Therefore,
        the library is independent from any specific blockchain, database solution,
        user interface, etc.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://standard.whiteflagprotocol.org/" target="_blank">Whiteflag Protocol specification</a>
        is an open standard. Version 1 of the WFJL corresponds with version 1 of the
        protocol, and more specifically with <strong>v1-draft.6</strong> of the standard.
        Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteflagProtocol/whiteflag-java/" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>
        for planned WFJL functionality and corresponding `1.x` subversions.</p>

    <h1>Packages</h1>
    <p>As any Java software, the Whiteflag Java Library (WFJL) is organised in packages.
        The WFJL software comprises the following Java packages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java</code>
            is the main package providing the external programming interface for
            software using this library. This packages defines the classes representing
            Whitelag messages and accounts.</li>
        <li><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java.core</code>
            contains all implementation independent core functionality as defined in
            the Whiteflag specification, such as the Whiteflag message definitions. This
            seperates the core protocol functionality from implementation-specific design
            decisions as much as possible.</li>
        <li><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java.crypto</code>
            contains all implementation independent cryptographic functionality as defined
            in the Whiteflag specification, such as encryption, key derivation and negatiation,
            and authentication. Seperating these critical security functions makes them better
            inspectable, testable and maintainable.</li>
        <li><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java.util</code>
            contains utilities used by the main protocol classes, but that are not part
            of the external interface and also not part of the protocol core, e.g. data
            conversions, such as conversion of Whiteflag message to and from JSON.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Example</h1>
    <p>After adding the WFJL as a dependency to your project, the WFJL classes can
        be used in your Java code. Your code may look like this:</p>
    <pre>
    {@code
        import org.whiteflagprotocol.java.WfMessage;
        import org.whiteflagprotocol.java.WfException;
        
        public class Example {
          /* Properties */
          private WfMessage message;
        
          /* Methods */
          public WfMessage decode(String hexString) throws WfException {
            message = WfMessage.decode(hexString);
            return message;
          }
        }
    }
    </pre>
