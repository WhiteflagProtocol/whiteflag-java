    <h2>Package Overview</h2>
    <p>As any Java software, the Whiteflag Java Library (WFJL) is organised in packages.
    The WFJL software consists of the following Java packages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="square"><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java</code> is the main package providing the
            external programming interface for software using this library. Normally,
            this is the only package required to import in your code.</li><br/>

        <li type="square"><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java.core</code> contains all implementation
            independent core functionality as defined in the Whiteflag specification,
            such as the Whiteflag message definitions. This seperates the core
            protocol functionality from implementation-specific design decisions
            as much as possible.</li><br/>

        <li type="square"><code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java.util</code> contains utilities used by
            the main protocol classes, but that are not part of the external interface
            and also not part of the protocol core, e.g. data conversions, such as
            conversion of Whiteflag message to and from JSON.</li><br/>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>After adding the WFJL as a dependency to your project, the WFJL classes can
        be used in your Java code. Normally, you will only need the classes from the
        <code>org.whiteflagprotocol.java</code> package. Your code may look like this:</p>
    <pre>
    {@code
        import org.whiteflagprotocol.java.WfMessage;
        import org.whiteflagprotocol.java.WfException;
        
        public class Example {
          private WfMessage message;
        
          public WfMessage createMessage(String messageType) {
            try {
              message = WfMessage.Creator.create(messageType);
            } catch(WfException e) {
              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot create a Whiteflag message of type " + messageType);
            }
            return message;
          }
        }
    }
    </pre>
